# SoftRenderer

This is a simple 3D renderer written in C++ just for fun, I use EazyX lib to create window and output render results.

It has a massive performance issue because I just use a simple and direct way to render.

It will show a cube at screen, you can use WASD to move and IJKL to rotate.

Cube will rotate each frame.
